## Instructions

Watch the [NEW Multi Instance & Wall Setup Video](https://youtu.be/0xAHMW93MQw)

## Usage

To use the macro, run TheWall.ahk and wait for it to say ready. Start up OBS, then start up a [Fullscreen projector](https://youtu.be/9YqZ6Ogv3rk).

On the Fullscreen projector, you have a few hotkeys: 
- (1-9): Will reset the instance with the corresponding number
- Shift + (1-9): Will play the instance with the corresponding number
- E: Will reset the instance which your mouse is hovering over
- R: Will play the instance which your mouse is hovering over
- F: Will play the instance which your mouse is hovering over, and reset all of the other ones
- T: Will reset all instances
- Shift + L Mouse button: Lock instance so other "blanket reset" functions skip over it

No longer moves worlds, it slows down the macro a lot, use [this world moving macro](https://gist.github.com/Specnr/f7a5450d932a1277fdcd6c141ad7bf6a).

## OBS Websocket

1) Download [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2) Install [OBS websocket](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/obs-websocket-remote-control-obs-studio-from-websockets.466/)
3) Open up command prompt, and run this command in `pip install obs-websocket-py`
4) Now, open up obs.py in whatever text editor you want. 
5) For scene_name_format you want to put in whatever the prefix of all your scenes are. 
6) For wall_scene_name, its pretty self explanetory, just put in the scene name of your wall.
7) Now, for the password, you can put in a password if you want, and if you use it you can go to `Tools -> WebSockets Server Settings -> Enable Authentication` and then put in whatever password you want. Then you can put the same password in the password variable quotes.

After that it should be working. Ping @Tech Support in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/tXxwrYw) if you have any issues.
